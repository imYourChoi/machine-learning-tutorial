## Introduction

The goal of this tutorial is to make it easy and convenient for beginners to learn __machine learning__. Beginners here mean those who are not computer science majors or who have little knowledge of artificial intelligence.

In this tutorial, we will explore the mechanism of machine learning by going through each step of the machine learning process. We will be using the [Palmer Penguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins) dataset, which is emerging as an alternative to the traditional [Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) dataset. The Iris dataset is very widely used in the data science community for various purposes and became a symbolic dataset in machine learning. However, due to the eugenicist past of the publisher, it is now excluded by the community. We are using an excellent alternative dataset, `Palmer Penguins`, which is also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ashkhagan/palmer-penguins-datasetalternative-iris-dataset).

The data was collected by _Dr. Kristen Gorman_ and the _Palmer Station_ and was packaged by, thanks, _Allison Horst_. The steps, laid out in the following content, are based on the [framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKW8Ndu7Mjw) of Yufeng Guo, a developer of Google.
